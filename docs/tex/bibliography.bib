  title={The \gls{CIE} colorimetric standards and their use},
  journal={Transactions of the Optical Society},
  volume={33},
  number={3},
  pages={73},
  year={1931},
  abstract={The new international standards, which define a standard observer,
three standard illuminants, standard conditions of illuminating and viewing
opaque specimens, a standard for evaluating the brightness factor of opaque
specimens, and a standard trichromatic system for the expression of colour
measurements, are stated and their origin explained. In addition to the
numerical tables which are appended to the resolutions setting up these
standards, there are given a table specifying the trichromatic coordinates for
the standard observer of all spectral colours at wave-length intervals of 1 mμ,
tables to facilitate the calculation of the standard coordinates and the
brightness factor of a material illuminated by any one of the three standard
illuminants from spectrophotometric measurements on the material, and a table
giving the coordinates of some stimuli of special importance on the N.P.L.
system, the standard system, and another system which occurs in the resolutions.
Some new colorimetric terms
are proposed, partly to avoid misinterpretation and partly to meet new needs.
The theory of colour transformations, and points which arise in the application
of the system and in the calibration of instruments, are discussed.}
