	description={
		An opening through which light can pass. 
		In an optical system such as a camera lens this is also called 
		\textsl{iris}, \textsl{entrance pupil} or \textsl{diaphragm} and is normally
		mounted inside the barrel of the lens system housing to limit the amount of 
		light admitted through it. 
		When an aperture is well approximated by a circle, it is normally measured 
		in one of two ways: either the diameter is specified directly, 
		usually in $[\unit{\milli\meter}]$, or when discussing camera lenses, the ratio 
		of the iris's diameter to the focal length is given, 
		and is called the \textsl{aperture number}.
		There is also a use of this term to indicate the \textsl{film gate}, which

		camera lens, this would mean the diameter of the lens's aperture 
		is $50 / 2.8 \approx 17.8\unit{\milli\meter}$. 
		Like other series used in photography, the
		numbers found on most lenses are taken from this standard series:
		$\sfrac{f}{1.4}$, $\sfrac{f}{2}$, $\sfrac{f}{2.8}$, $\sfrac{f}{4}$, $\sfrac{f}{5.6}$,
		$\sfrac{f}{8}$, $\sfrac{f}{11}$, $\sfrac{f}{16}$, $\sfrac{f}{22}$, $\sfrac{f}{32}$,

		each covering 180 degrees and set up to complete one revolution per frame. 
		During setup these can be set to leave an opening between 0 and the

		The remaining time, called \textsl{blanking}, is used to advance the film
		to the position of the following frame. The exposure time resulting from this

		The notes to this entry in~\cite{iso:22028-1:2016} specify that:
		scene-referred image data can be determined from raw \gls{DSC} image data before colour-rendering is performed. Consumer-oriented \glspl{DSC} sometimes do not write scene-referred image data in image files, but some may do so in a special mode intended for this purpose. Otherwise it would be typical behaviour of \glspl{DSC} to write standard output-referred image data where colour-rendering has already been performed. Cameras intended
		for professional use typically support this capability.
		Scene-referred image data typically represent \emph{relative} scene colourimetry estimates. 
		When needed, \emph{absolute} scene colourimetry estimates may be calculated using a scaling factor. 
		The scaling factor can be derived from additional information such as the image \gls{OECF}, 
		\gls{f-number} or \gls{aperture number}, and \gls{exposure time} or \gls{shutter speed} tags.
		Scene-referred image data may contain inaccuracies due to the dynamic range limitations of the capture device, noise from various sources, quantization, optical blurring and flare that are not corrected for, and colour analysis errors due to capture device metamerism. In some cases, these sources of inaccuracy can be significant.
		The transformation from raw \gls{DSC} image data to scene-referred image data depends on the relative adopted whites selected for the scene and the colour space used to encode the image data. If the chosen scene adopted white is inappropriate, additional errors will be introduced into the scene-referred image data. These errors may be correctable if the transformation used to produce the scene-referred image data are known and the colour encoding used for the incorrect scene-referred image data has adequate precision and dynamic range.
		The scene may correspond to an actual view of the natural world or may be a computer-generated \gls{virtual} scene simulating such a view. It may also correspond to a modified scene determined by applying modifications to an original scene to produce some different desired scene. Any such scene modifications should leave the image in a scene-referred image state and should be done in the context of an expected colour-rendering transform}

	name={shutter},
	seealso={aperture,camera lens,exposure time,filmback},
	description={A component in a camera design to open for a brief period of time, called the 
		\textsl{exposure time}, to permit light to arrive at the filmback. 
		Most often the shutter is mounted on the camera body between the camera lens 
		and the filmback, but in large format photography leaf shutters are available as 
		independent parts of the kit, and are sometimes installed ``sandwiched'' in the
		middle of a so-called two-part lens, so it sits as close as possible to the
		aperture}

{

	description={An adjective to indicate the value in question (usually a radiometric quantity)
		is to be intended as per unit wavelength. For example, \textsl{spectral radiant power}
		$\Phi_\lambda = \partial\Phi_e / \partial\lambda$ is the partial derivative of 
		radiant power with respect to the wavelength. This is measured in 
		\unit{\watt\per\meter} or sometimes \unit{\watt\per\nano\meter}.
		It is also common (but not used in this document), to use the partial derivative
		with respect to frequency, for which a $\nu$ subscript is used, as in $\Phi_\nu$}

{

		derivative of radiant power with respect to wavelength. 
		Distributions are a key concept in the field of probability, 
		where continuous distributions are called \textsl{densities}}

\newglossaryentry{strobing}
{

		brightness in a temporal sense, ``flickering'', or showing uneven ``jolty'' motion.
		It is a manifestation of the \textsl{stroboscopic effect}, which is more typically
		associated with the appearance of wheels or propellers spinning in the opposite direction
		as their actual motion, often at a different, much lower speed}

\newglossaryentry{stop}
{
	name={stop},
	seealso={film speed,exposure time,aperture},
	description={In photography, stops are changes to the exposure settings that
		double or halve the amount of light admitted during one exposure. 
		They are so called because they correspond to the action of going to the 
		next detent position on the shutter timing gear on the camera or on the 
		aperture ring on the lens barrel, which respectively doubles the 
		exposure time or the aperture area.
		For consistency, film stock is usally rated also in stops, 
		resulting in the base ratings as described in \gls{film speed}. 
		Stops tend to be subdivided in thirds, which correspond
		to an increment of 1 unit on the \glsname{DIN} sensisitivity scale}
}

\newglossaryentry{T-stop}
{
	name={T-stop},
	seealso={f-number,aperture number,camera lens},
	description={A \textsl{transmission stop} is a way to mark aperture numbers on a camera lens
		where the physical size of the aperture is calibrated at manufacturing time 
		to compensate for the light lost through the various elements of the lens, 
		so to admit as much light as it would be admitted if these elements had $100\%$
		transmittance.
		Camera lenses intended for cinema use are normally calibrated with T-stops, 
		because this enables producing footage of identical brightness independent of
		which one camera lens is used from the cinematographer's lens kit selected for the show.
		The T-stop idea was first proposed in \cite{ph2290_52} and then turned into a series
		of standards up to \cite{ansi:it3.606-1998}}
