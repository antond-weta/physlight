		In an optical system such as a camera lens this is also called 
		\textsl{entrance pupil} or \textsl{diaphragm} and is normally
		mounted inside the barrel of the lens to admit light through it. 
		When the aperture is well approximated by a circle, it is normally measured 
		in one of two ways: either the diameter is specified directly, 
		usually in $[\unit{\milli\meter}]$, or when discussing camera lenses, the ratio 
		of the aperture's diameter to the focal length is given, 
		and is called the \textsl{aperture number}}

		camera lens, this would mean the diameter of the lens's aperture 
		is $50 / 2.8 \approx 17.8\unit{\milli\meter}$. 
		Like other series used in photography, the

		$\sfrac{f}{1.4}$, $\sfrac{f}{2}$, $\sfrac{f}{2.8}$, $\sfrac{f}{4}$, $\sfrac{f}{5.6}$,
		$\sfrac{f}{8}$, $\sfrac{f}{11}$, $\sfrac{f}{16}$, $\sfrac{f}{22}$, $\sfrac{f}{32}$,
		each in an approximate ratio of $\sqrt{2}$ to the next one, corresponding to a doubling/halving of admitted light from the previous one.

		In motion pictures the convention is to speak of \textsl{shutter angle}:
		in a motion picture film camera the shutter is made of two half circle ``blades'' 
		each covering 180 degrees and set up to complete one revolution per frame. 
		During setup these can be set to leave an opening between 0 and the
		full 180 degrees during which light is admitted onto the film stock.
		The remaining time, called \textsl{blanking}, is used to advance the film
		to the position of the following frame. The exposure time resulting from this

		The standard had previously been proposed by \glsname{ASA}

		\textsl{\glsname{ISO}/\glsname{ASA}}. 
		Also common was the German system standardized by \glsname{DIN}, which instead
