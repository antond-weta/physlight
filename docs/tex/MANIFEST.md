# Manifest of content included in the PhysLight documentation

Figures in the physLight document are processed with our document
build system. The source data is in `figures_src` and the
built content goes in `figures_built`.
All paths below are relative to `figures_src`

## Figures based on external work

The document chapter called "Radiance" reproduces a 1963 paper by Fred Nicodemus,

## External datasets

CIE data is available at `https://cie.co.at/data-tables` under CC BY-SA 4.0
for each file both the data and the metadata JSON files are in the project
directory `figures_src/data/cie/`

The data in `data/rosco/roscolux.csv` was copied from `https://emea.rosco.com/en/products/catalog/roscolux`

Most camera sensitivity data is from `http://www.gujinwei.org/research/camspec/db.html` Copyright (C) Rochester Institute of Technology,
licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.
This same file (and presumably license) was originally available at `http://www.cis.rit.edu/jwgu/research/camspec/camspec_database.txt`
however the link is not working any more. Files under this license have the RIT URL in them.

The data for the Red Mysterium X sensor is from `http://colorpipe.mikrosimage.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CIC_Sarlat_draft.pdf`
