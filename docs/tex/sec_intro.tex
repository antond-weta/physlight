\section{Why physical units?}

One of the reasons physically-based image synthesis has become such an
indispensable ingredient for pushing realism and consistency in very
complex scenarios is predictability. Material modelling is based on
physical properties and thus allows to reproduce increasingly complex
natural phenomena. In traditional rendering systems, control of the
look was often owned by the shading system, often allowing artistic
control knobs for artificial emission or non-physical behavior to
compensate for lighting, for example missing indirect illumination.

The physically-based rendering paradigm dictates that \glspl{material model},
lighting and camera response are independent entities and
must hence always be controlled with this separation in mind. 
This makes \gls{virtual} assets more reusable, 
and allows to achieve better consistency when integrating 
digitally produced content with live action \gls{footage}.

Naturally, since a wide range of different effects interplay with each
other in complex and subtle ways, it is absolutely crucial that all
components are accurately represented by their virtual analogues to be
able to reproduce real-world footage realistically. 
Furthermore, the description of the \gls{virtual scene} being based on
real-world quantities enables easier control and verification.

In this document we focus on the specification of \gls{virtual} \glspl{illuminant} and
\glspl{sensor} and make the case for using the same conventions and physical units as
used by lighters and photographers on a motion picture set or in a photographic studio. 
For example, it is preferable in terms of predictability to think about brightness of a 
light source in terms of \glsdisp{photometry}{photometric} units, i.e., units which represent brightness as
perceived by a \gls{human observer}, rather than \glsdisp{radiometry}{radiometric} ones 
(commonly called \gls{wattage}) for two reasons: 
firstly there is convention: the normally used wattage reported on a light fixture or bulb 
is a measure of the power absorbed by the object, not the power of the radiation it emits in the visible range\footnote{This is effectively the concept of  
	\textsl{\gls{luminous efficacy}}, being the ratio of power absorbed by the emitter
	to the luminous power emitted. 
	What used to be the common household lightbulb, containing incandescent tungsten and 
	rated for 100W, had a luminous efficacy of roughly $15\unit{\lumen\per\watt}$, 
	a contemporary \glsname{LED} lightbulb would be somewhere between 
	$100\unit{\lumen\per\watt}$ and $200\unit{\lumen\per\watt}$, 
	a Xenon arc-lamp somewhere between $30\unit{\lumen\per\watt}$ and
	$90\unit{\lumen\per\watt}$.} onto the \gls{scene}. 
Secondly, the perceived \gls{brightness} of a source has a fairly marked dependence on 
its color, making lights emitting the same amount of radiative power (even when measured 
limited to the visible spectrum only) appear to have different brightnesses. 

We want instead to specify a system of units and models, in such a manner that
given a real-world scene and a virtual model of it,
specifying the same illuminants via our chosen units, using the same
camera settings and feeding the scene to a compliant renderer will replicate 
the same pixel values as would come from a real-world camera places in the 
real-world version. 
Naturally, for reproducing color, we will not only need
to develop an accurate understanding of brightness, but also be aware
of how \gls{spectral} data flows through the \gls{pipeline}.



The resulting system has been in use in the
production pipeline at W\=et\=a FX since about 2015.
Because of the origin of this system in the motion picture industry,
several terms of the trade have made it into this document. 


The prevalent way of reasoning about image synthesis through rendering is 
built on the notion of the \textsl{light ray}, which is the fundamental element 
of geometrical optics. 
Light rays are the path segments\footnote{
	In the vast majority of renderers in use today, rays are implemented as 
	straight line segments, which enormously simplifies the implementation of the
	code that finds their endpoints. This ignores two effects: the first is that 
	gravity bends light rays: this won't be an important effect for scenes with 
	extents up to maybe hundreds of thousands of kilometers, likely more depending
	on the accuracy needed. 
	There are exceptions, however: for example the movie~\cite{interstellar2014} 
	instead did need to capture the bending effect of gravity onto light paths 
	accurately, and a specialized rendering system was developed for the show. 
	The task was complex enough that the Nobel laureate and Cal Tech professor 
	Kip Thorne was included as consultant to support the team developing this 
	technology. 
	The second effect ignored by the straight-line approximation is that 
	variations in the index of refraction of the medium that
	the light is traversing can also bend the light paths. 
	This is a substantially more common effect at human scale, for example 
	it's the origin of the \textsl{mirage} phenomenon. 
	While there are several research projects that have built renderers able 
	to capture this effect, the computational costs associated with this capability 
	are high enough to make it impractical for everyday use
} through space that light follows when traveling across the \gls{virtual scene}. 

This document is divided in parts: \cref{part:models}
contains an introduction on basic quantities that are relevant in
light transport simulation and review the relation of photometric and
radiometric units and describes the modelling aspects. In 
\cref{ch:lighting} we describe imaging and light models and propose the
relevant sets of parameters to specify them accurately.  
\Cref{ch:calcsheets} provides some examples on how to derive some of
the described quantities from real world examples.

\Cref{part:ref} provides a reference covering measurements of various 
illuminants (\cref{ch:illuminants}) and cameras (\cref{ch:sensors}).

\Cref{part:app} contains the appendices: \cref{ch:color} discusses
various considerations on color, in particular covering the relation between 
the tristimulus versus spectral settings,
\cref{ch:implementation} describes an implementation of a color manipulation library
and \cref{ch:radiance} is an extensive excerpt from Frederic Nicodemus's 
excellent 1963 paper~\cite{nicodemus63} in which the concept of \textsl{\gls{radiance}}
is introduced: unsurprisingly we found his explanation far clearer than what we 
had been able to come up with, so we decided to retype his text, with the only change being
we have changed the equations to use contemporary conventions for quantity names, and adopted
contemporary \glsname{si} units throughout.

Because this document is the result of work started from the movie industry, 
we are aware several concepts may not be as well known to our readers from different backgrounds. 
For this reasons we have compiled a reference of notation and symbols used in~\cref{ch:notation} 
as well as a glossary in \cref{sec:main} with the hope these might help clarify potential issues arising 
from our use of movie-making jargon.

\section{Quantities in light transport}

We discussed how \gls{rendering} is concerned with simulating how light travels around in 
a \gls{virtual scene}, so this section introduces names for the quantities transported 
along these paths during the simulation and outlines the theory behind them. 
The naming we adopt for them is in line with several contemporary international standards, 
among which we mention ISO/IEC Standard 80000, 
\emph{Quantities and units, part 7: Light and radiation}~\cite{iso:80000-7:2019}, 
the \emph{International lighting vocabulary} published\footnote{Can also be consulted 
	online at \url{https://cie.co.at/e-ilv}} by the \gls{CIE}~\cite{cie:s017.2020},
and the lighting section of the so-called ``Electropedia'' from the \gls{IEC}~\cite{iec:60050-845:2020}.
Work in recent years has gone into harmonizing these bodies of knowledge so that the resulting 
vocabularies are fully aligned. 

%The objective is to formalize a system of physical absolute units to be used
%when describing lighting, \glspl{material model} and imaging in the
%process of digital image synthesis. 
%This allows us to bring scene values in line
%with real-life measurements, in order to facilitate integration of
%live action footage and digitally created content. 
The specification of how units from the \gls{si} are injected in 
the pipeline and the mathematics that corresponds to the quantities 
involved are here described in detail.

Thinking about light flowing through a scene, rendering is concerned with the so-called
\textsl{particle theory} of light: these particles are called \textsl{photons}, 
and \textsl{light rays} represent paths along which these photons flow.
The particle theory of light describes a photon as a very small ``object'' 
(a \textsl{particle}) having no mass and no electrical charge, 
instead being made entirely of energy\footnote{
	All readers troubled by this description are in good company. In fact there are 
	certainly substantial theoretical and experimental problems in describing precisely
 	aspects of a photon such as its position. For example the \textsl{Heisenberg uncertainty}
 	in a way only begins to scratch the surface of this problem}. Planck talked about
energy \textsl{quanta}: because of what photons are, energy can only come to be in 
certain specific amounts as can be captured by integral amounts of photons (there is no
such thing as $0.234$ photons, photons are integer and indivisible, they are viewed in
this theory are \textsl{elementary particles}).
So each photon effectively \emph{is} a (small) quantity of energy, and this in turn 
depends on its wavelength $\lambda$ and is equal to $Q_p = hc/\lambda$ 
(where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ the speed of light in vacuum). Equivalently,
the energy of a photon could be expressed as $Q_p = h\nu$ where $\nu = c/\lambda$ is the
photon's \textsl{frequency}. In this work we have chosen to work with wavelengths, so we won't
see much discussion of frequency and $\nu$'s.

As much as photons are the elemental ingredients of light transport, 
they obviously must come from somewhere, which we call \textsl{light sources}.
Given a light source that has been shining for a period of time, it will have emitted a
certain number $N_p$ of photons, delivering a corresponding amount of energy $Q_e$, measured in
joule \unit{\joule}. 
And this brings us to discuss the notion of \textsl{power} of our source, being its ability
to emit light over a unit of time. Given that light is energy, and as we said we measure energy
in \unit\joule, the emission rate of time over time $Q_e/t$ will be measured in watts \unit\watt,
which are just joules per second $\unit\watt = \unit{\joule\per\second}$.

What we are going to do over the rest of this section is to continue to break down 
this aggregate notion of ``power of a light source'' into simpler components, so 
that we can understand what quantity flows through a ``ray of light''.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HERE
For this reason, we start from the amount of power emitted by our source $S$:
the \textsl{emissive radiant power}.
This can be seen as the energy flowing through a sphere fully enclosing $S$.
More precisely, we define the \textsl{emissive radiant flux} $\Phi_e$ of a
source $S$ through a given surface $A$ as the amount of energy from $S$ that
crosses $A$ per unit time. This flux will be called \textsl{total} when the surface
$A$ fully encloses the source $S$. Total flux will be called \textsl{power} in
this document, and is measured in watts $[\unit{\watt}]$.

It is natural to think of radiant power as originating from a region $\delta S$ on our source:
for instance a source like a stained glass window would emit different amounts of energy 
across its surface, as a consequence of the different absorptions of the different pieces of
colored glass that it's made of. 
This leads to an intuitive notion of radiant power from a specific point $x$ on the surface 
of the source $M_e(x)$, and we would like this to be defined so that total power 
from our source $S$ would be computed directly by integration over all of its surface:
\begin{displaymath}
\Phi_e = \int_{S} M_e(x) \d x \qquad [\unit{\watt}]
\end{displaymath}
this quantity $M_e$ is called \textsl{radiosity} and represents the area density
of radiant power coming from our source, formally
\begin{displaymath}
M_e = \frac{\d\Phi_e}{\d S} \qquad \left[\unit{\watt\per\square\meter}\right]
\end{displaymath}
It is immediately verified that for a uniformly emissive source the
radiosity is simply the ratio of emissive power to area
$M_e = \Phi_e / S$.

In a similar way, one could consider a notion of power leaving the source $S$ in
a given
direction $\omega$.
As before we would like this quantity defined so that the power in a range of
directions
$\Omega$ could be directly computed by integration:
\begin{displaymath}
\Phi_e = \int_\Omega I_e(\omega) \d\omega \qquad [\unit{\watt}]
\end{displaymath}
the integrand $I_e(\omega)$ is called \textsl{radiant intensity} and represent
the density
of power with respect to directions from the source, formally
\begin{displaymath}
I_e = \frac{\d\Phi_e}{\d\Omega} \qquad \left[\unit{\watt\per\steradian}\right]
\end{displaymath}
it is very important to note that radiant intensity should be considered a
``far-field'' quantity, that is to say, a quantity that is only valid when
the source is extremely small in comparison to the other dimensions at play.
The interested reader is invited to consult~\cite{nicodemus63}, a relevant
extract of which is included in \cref{ch:radiance} of this document.

Now that we have a notion of power \textit{from a region} and power \textit{in
a given direction}, we can combine the two to get power \textit{from a region
in a given direction}, which as before is a quantity that lets us compute
power by integration in area and direction:
\begin{displaymath}
\Phi_e = \int_{S} \int_\Omega L_e^\uparrow(x, \omega) \;\cos\theta\d x\d\omega
\qquad [\unit{\watt}]
\end{displaymath}
the integrand $L_e^\uparrow(x, \omega)$ is called \textsl{exitant radiance}
and represents the power density with respect to area and directions from
the source, formally
\begin{displaymath}
L_e^\uparrow = \frac{\d\Phi_e}{\cos\theta \d S \d\Omega}
\qquad \left[\unit{\watt\per\square\meter\per\steradian}\right]
\end{displaymath}
in some cases it might be convenient to distinguish exitant radiance from
incident radiance and this will be indicated with an arrow in the exponent:
exitant radiance pointing up $L_e^\uparrow$ and incident radiance pointing down
$L_e^\downarrow$.

Here, $\theta$ denotes the angle between the direction $\omega$ and the normal.
The so called \emph{projected solid angle} $\d\omega^\bot := \cos \theta \d \omega$
accounts for the change of flux received per infinitesimal area by a beam of light
according to its orientation towards the surface.

    all directions $\Omega$. Integrating $L_e$ over both the surface and all directions yields power. }
\end{figure}

One can think of incident radiance as photons along a ray reaching a surface.
This also can vary across a region so it is natural to formulate a notion
of incident power density across an area on the receiver.
The total incident flux of a region $R$ on the receiver can then be computed by
integration over its surface:
\begin{displaymath}
\Phi_e = \int_{R} E_e(x) \d x \qquad [\unit{\watt}]
\end{displaymath}
the value $E_e(x)$ is the receiver's area density of incident power and
is called \textit{irradiance}.
Much like radiosity, irradiance as well has a differential formulation:
\begin{displaymath}
E_e = \frac{\d\Phi_e}{\d R} \qquad \left[\unit{\watt\per\square\meter}\right]
\end{displaymath}

Comparing all the relations above, we can express radiosity, radiant intensity
and irradiance in terms of radiance:
\begin{displaymath}
M_e(x) = \int_\Omega L_e^\uparrow(x,\omega) \;\cos\theta \d\omega \quad
I_e(\omega) = \int_S L_e^\uparrow(x,\omega) \d x \quad
E_e(x) = \int_\Omega L_e^\downarrow(x,\omega) \;\cos\theta \d\omega
\end{displaymath}

Somewhat orthogonally to all the above, we can consider spectral distributions
of all these quantities, which we simply define as the spectral densities of the
quantities above:
\begin{displaymath}
\Phi_{\lambda} = \frac{\d\Phi_e}{\d\lambda} \quad
M_{\lambda} = \frac{\d\Phi_{\lambda}}{\d S} \quad
I_{\lambda} = \frac{\d\Phi_{\lambda}}{\d\Omega} \quad
E_{\lambda} = \frac{\d\Phi_{\lambda}}{\d R} \quad
L_{\lambda}^\uparrow = \frac{\d\Phi_{\lambda}}{\d S \d\Omega} \quad
L_{\lambda}^\downarrow = \frac{\d\Phi_{\lambda}}{\d R \d\Omega}
\end{displaymath}

{\footnotesize\it We abbreviate the unit for luminous energy \textit{talbot} as

We also use the convention of subscripting photometric quantities
with $v$ (for \textit{visual}), radiometric quantities with $e$ (for
\textit{energetic}) and spectral radiometric quantities with $\lambda$;
this follows the recommendations in documents such as~\cite{united1967usa}.}
\end{table}

One of the central points of this document is to put units to the pixel values in a raster image. 
For the purpose of this introductory section, we will focus on the generation of grayscale images, where each pixel records the \textsl{\gls{brightness}} of a scene at its respective location. In particular, and throughout this whole document, we will use the term \textsl{brightness} to indicate a non-specific, informal, plain-English, everyday meaning that a quantity may feel more or less ``dim'' to a human observer. 
The discussion will then proceed to specify the exact meaning in question more precisely and give it an appropriate name.

As we have just seen, radiometric quantities can be used to measure brightness in terms of \emph{\gls{radiant power}}.
However, if our image was generated using values proportional to this quantity,
we would obtain an image that will likely not correspond well to the subjective sense of brightness in the scene as experienced by a person looking at it. 
This is because the human visual system is not equally sensitive to all wavelengths
of light, and may perceive light emanating or reflecting off two objects with different total radiative energy as having the same brightness, as a consequence of differences in the spectral distributions only. 
Conversely, \gls{spectral distribution} carrying the same amount
of total radiative energy may be perceived as having different brightness levels.

It is therefore useful to reason about the energy of light in two
different ways, one dealing with energy, called \textsl{radiometric}, and the
other tuned to human perception, called \textsl{photometric}. The two approaches
have historically been using a great number of units, a few of which were
included in the \gls{si} at the Eleventh Conference on Weights and Measures
held in 1960.  Many details around various historical and \gls{si} units are
described in~\cite{Meyer-Arendt:68}.

From the point of view of \textsl{\gls{radiometry}}, the \textsl{radiant power} of a
source $S$
(also called \textsl{total radiant flux}) is measured in
\textit{watts} $[\unit{\watt}]$ and is the total amount of energy per unit time
emitted by $S$.
%This means that two different light sources emitting the same radiant power and
%having different spectral distributions are likely to appear as having different
%brightness.

On the other hand, from the point of view of \textsl{\gls{photometry}}, the
\textsl{luminous power}
of a source $S$ (called \textsl{luminous flux}) is measured in
\textit{lumens} $[\unit{\lumen}]$, and is the amount of energy per unit time
weighted by the \textsl{photopic luminous efficiency function} $\bar y(\lambda)$. 
This function was designed to model the response of the human visual system as a function of wavelength $\lambda$\footnote{
	The photopic luminosity function $\bar y(\lambda)$ is the result of a series of experiments and tabulations first published by the \gls{CIE} in 1924 (the function was called $V(\lambda)$ at the time) and then included in the color matching functions for the \emph{standard 2 degree colorimetric observer}~\parencite{smithgould1931}.}.

This means that two different light sources emitting the same luminous
power will appear as having about the same brightness even when having
different spectral distributions\footnote{This
statement can only be true approximately, as the specific spectral response
of different humans exhibits a certain amount of variation, even among
normal subjects.
Also there are subjects having various different kinds of anomalies in their
visual systems (such as color blindness), for whom this statement ends up being even less accurate}.

More formally, a photometric quantity $X_v(\ldots)$ is obtained from 
the corresponding radiometric spectral quantity $X_{\lambda}(\ldots, \lambda)$
integrating
\begin{equation}
X_v(\ldots) = K_m \int X_{\lambda}(\ldots,\lambda)\; \bar y (\lambda) \d\lambda.
\label{eqn:rad_to_photo}
\end{equation}
For example, given spectral radiant power $\Phi_{\lambda}(\lambda)$, the
corresponding
luminous power $\Phi_v$ is
\begin{displaymath}
\Phi_v = K_m \int \Phi_{\lambda}(\lambda)\; \bar y(\lambda) \d\lambda.
\end{displaymath}

The scaling constant $K_m$ converts watts to lumens. It can be determined
from the 
\gls{si} unit \textsl{candela} $[\unit{\candela}]$, which was adopted at
the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1979 and
there formally defined as follows:
\begin{quote}
\emph{One candela is the amount of luminous intensity of a source of
monochromatic radiation of frequency \num{540}\unit{\tera\hertz} and
a radiant intensity of $1/683$\unit{\watt\per\steradian}.}
\end{quote}

$\num{540}\unit{\tera\hertz}$ correspond to about \num{555.016}\unit{\nano\meter} in
standard air, a wavelength in the greens to which the eye of the standard observer
is most sensitive.
The radiant intensity of $1/683\unit{\watt\per\steradian}$ was chosen to make the candela about equal to the
\textit{standard candle}, the unit which it superseded. 

Note that the above definition is an updated version of the original definition, which had been
valid since 1933 and was based on the emission of a blackbody radiator
at the freezing point of platinum, about \num{2042}\unit{\kelvin}. This 
historical definition is sometimes also found in literature~\parencite{Meyer-Arendt:68}.

Using Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:rad_to_photo} and the Dirac delta distribution $\delta$, the
above definition can be written as
\begin{displaymath}
    1 \unit{\candela} = 1\frac{\unit{\lumen}}{\unit{\steradian}} 
    = K_m \int \frac{\delta(\lambda-555.016\unit{\nano\meter})}{683} \unit{\watt\per\steradian}\;\bar y(\lambda) \d\lambda
    = K_m \cdot \frac{\bar y(555.016\unit{\nano\meter})}{683}\unit{\watt\per\steradian},
\end{displaymath}
from which it follows that $K_m \approx 683.002 \;\unit{\lumen\per\watt}$. In 
practice, however, it is safe to use the value of $683\;\unit{\lumen\per\watt}$~\parencite{cie1996,wyszecki2000}.
